# Photos Folder

To add your own photos to the gallery:

1. Place your image files in this `/public/photos/` folder
2. Name them `photo1.jpg`, `photo2.jpg`, etc. (or update the filenames in `src/components/PhotoGallery.tsx`)
3. Supported formats: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
4. Recommended dimensions: 800px width, varying heights for the masonry effect

The gallery will automatically load images from this folder. Simply replace the placeholder images with your own photography!

## Current Structure:
- photo1.jpg through photo12.jpg (placeholder images)
- You can add more by updating the photos array in PhotoGallery.tsx
